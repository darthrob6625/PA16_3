## Module 17: Practical Application 3

### Problem Statement
The objective of this assignment is to construct and evaluate multiple machine learning classification models for the purpose of assessing marketing campaigns within a banking organization. Specifically, the models to be developed and optimized include k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. The banking organization has requested an evaluation of the effectiveness of its marketing campaigns in order to determine whether customers are likely to respond positively.

###  Project Workflow
- Data check
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Classification Modeling
- Results & Analysis

### Data Analysis
The dataset comprises 21 features and more than 40,000 records, including 10 numerical features and 10 categorical features. After one-hot encoding of the categorical variables, the total number of features, prior to evaluation and further processing, was ###.

### Evaluation & Findings

| Classification Model | Model Accuracy | After Optimization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | 0 | 0 |
| Decision Trees | 0 | 0 |
| Support Vector Machines | 0 | 0 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 0 | 0 |
